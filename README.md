# What is ABALONCO
ABALONCO is a project inspired by [a Starbound mod I like a lot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729444820) that somewhat reimplements Starbound's wiring system within itself, [as well as another one that uses Starbound's wiring system for item and energy connections of its' own machines](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149).

I quickly jumped from the idea of the first mod as a standalone program to making it compile everything to making actual proper(as proper as they can be*) programs in it and optimizing it to the best of my abilities.

Nothing new with me, a simple idea turns into one for some kind of an ultimate blocky constructor that might even become usable to make an entire OS if I'm given enough time and manage to spend it on that...
